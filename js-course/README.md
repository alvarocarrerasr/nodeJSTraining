# JS Course

I didn't want to start learning NodeJS without having any idea about the special (or weird) JS parts.

Most of JS main structures are shared among other programming languages, for instance, loops and alternative structures, but the fun things, the ones which allow you to perform more interesting things, for example classes, functions and methods, are very different to the traditional programming languages, like Java, C or C++.

So, I made several exercises, but as a general rule they were only simple examples. That's the reason why I finally made a main guide, very useful in case of students who have the base we can get programming with Java, but want to start learning JS. I will update it as long as I learn more interesting things of JS and of course, the guide is in spanish.

Most ideas of this guide have their origin in the most popular JS Course in Udemy, JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/.
