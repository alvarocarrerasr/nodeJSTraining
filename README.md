# Learning the NodeJS basics

This repository was created to mantain the source code of all the exercises and tests I make to learn NodeJS.


At this moment, I am only hosting the exercises proposed in the Udemy Course  The Complete Node JS Developer Course 2 (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2).
