# Learning the NodeJS basics

This repository was created to mantain the source code of all the exercises and tests I make to learn NodeJS.


At this moment, I am only hosting the exercises proposed in the Udemy Course  The Complete Node JS Developer Course 2 (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2).

* Note App: This is a very simple app, which adds, lists, removes and reads notes (title and body) using a single JSON object stored in a file. It uses async and sync I/O operations.
* Weather App: The project uses async I/O to collect weather information from an API. Moreover, it is possible to get user's current position and from that information, show the weather prediction.


To conclude, I have also uploaded a personal guide, this time in Spanish, about the weirdest aspects of JavaScript. Whatsmore, I include too my NodeJS notes.
