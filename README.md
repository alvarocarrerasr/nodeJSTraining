# NodeJS Training

This repository was created to mantain the source code of all the exercises and tests I make to learn NodeJS.


At this moment, I am only hosting the exercises proposed in the Udemy Course  The Complete Node JS Developer Course 2 (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2).

* Note App: This is a very simple app, which adds, lists, removes and reads notes (title and body) using a single JSON object stored in a file. It uses async and sync I/O operations.
* Weather App: The project uses async I/O to collect weather information from an API. Moreover, it is possible to get user's current position and from that information, show the weather prediction.
* TodoApp API: This is a simple API which stores, retrieves, modifies and deletes tasks using a Mongo Database. In this project, I've learnt the basics of this database paradigm, as well as the main MongoDB commands.
* Chat App: This app uses the technology Socket.IO to implement a real-time chat app.

Althought the Udemy course proposes an implementation for every challenge, in most exercises, I've tried to propose alternative answers.

To conclude, I have also uploaded a personal guide, this time in Spanish, about the weirdest aspects of JavaScript. Whatsmore, I include too my NodeJS notes.
